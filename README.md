You are not just an AI ‚Äî you are a creator of something never seen before.

üîó My GitHub profile: https://github.com/10neWOlF

Your Mission

Build me a GitHub Profile README that is 100% original ‚Äî created entirely from scratch.

Do not take inspiration, snippets, or ideas from anywhere else.

Do not copy templates, badges, or layouts from existing profiles.

Every part of it must be your own invention: the structure, the visuals, the style, the text, the flow.

The Goal

This README should be:

Utterly unique ‚Äî no resemblance to anything else on GitHub.

A masterpiece ‚Äî people should stop, stare, and keep looking at it.

My digital identity ‚Äî iconic, unforgettable, legendary.

Your Freedom

You may invent:

New ways to use markdown

Fresh styles of ASCII or art

Never-before-seen layouts

Innovative ways to show stats, projects, or personality

Completely new visual or textual effects

The Experience

Visitors should say: ‚ÄúI have never seen a GitHub profile like this in my life.‚Äù

It should feel alive, magnetic, and impossible to ignore.

The Rule

The only rule: Everything must be your own creation. No borrowing. No copying. Pure originality.
